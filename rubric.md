## Project Workflow
Performing - Really great planning directory. User stories were good although not in normal formats. And you got pretty good wireframes. Seems like you did a great deal of planning for this project and it paid off! Would finish off that readme though.

## Technical Requirements
Excelling - Awesome job getting many to many working. Your application has 4 models that leverages many associations. Additionally your app is using carrier wave, really cool!

## Code Quality
Performing - Codes pretty property formatted; however, I encourage you to put more comments in your code base. Especially the trickier parts. Also there's a couple of files your are not using, so remove those in production.

## Creativity Interface
Performing - Really like the interface, styles are nice and clean. Looks nice and is a great way to track recipes you have.
